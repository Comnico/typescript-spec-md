# 9 Enums

An enum type is a distinct subtype of the Number primitive type with an associated set of named
constants that define the possible values of the enum type.

## 9.1 Enum Declarations

An enum declaration declares an ***enum type*** and an ***enum object*** in the containing module.

```text
EnumDeclaration:
    enum Identifier { EnumBodyopt }
```

The enum type and enum object declared by an *EnumDeclaration* both have the name given by the
*Identifier* of the declaration. The enum type is a distinct subtype of the Number primitive type. The enum
object is a variable of an anonymous object type containing a set of properties, all of the enum type,
corresponding to the values declared for the enum type in the body of the declaration. The enum object's
type furthermore includes a numeric index signature with the signature `[x: number]: string`.

The *Identifier* of an enum declaration may not be one of the predefined type names (section 3.6.1).

The example

```typescript
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }
```

declares a subtype of the Number primitive type called `Color` and introduces a variable `Color` with a
type that corresponds to the declaration

```typescript
var Color: {
    [x: number]: string;
    Red: Color;
    Green: Color;
    Blue: Color;
};
```

The numeric index signature reflects a "reverse mapping" that is automatically generated in every enum
object, as described in section 9.4. The reverse mapping provides a convenient way to obtain the string
representation of an enum value. For example

```typescript
var c = Color.Red;
console.log(Color[c]); // Outputs "Red"
```

## 9.2 Enum Members

The body of an enum declaration defines zero or more enum members which are the named values of the
enum type. Each enum member has an associated numeric value of the primitive type introduced by the
enum declaration.

```text
EnumBody:
    ConstantEnumMembers ,opt
    ConstantEnumMembers , EnumMemberSections ,opt
    EnumMemberSections ,opt

ConstantEnumMembers:
    PropertyName
    ConstantEnumMembers , PropertyName

EnumMemberSections:
    EnumMemberSection
    EnumMemberSections , EnumMemberSection

EnumMemberSection:
    ConstantEnumMemberSection
    ComputedEnumMember

ConstantEnumMemberSection:
    PropertyName = NumericLiteral
    PropertyName = NumericLiteral , ConstantEnumMembers

ComputedEnumMember:
    PropertyName = AssignmentExpression
```

Enum members are either ***constant members*** or ***computed members***. Constant members have known
constant values that are substituted in place of references to the members in the generated JavaScript
code. Computed members have values that are computed at run-time and not known at compile-time.
No substitution is performed for references to computed members.

The body of an enum declaration consists of an optional *ConstantEnumMembers* production followed by
any number of *ConstantEnumMemberSection* or *ComputedEnumMember* productions.

* If present, the initial *ConstantEnumMembers* production introduces a series of constant members
with consecutive integral values starting at the value zero.
* A *ConstantEnumMemberSection* introduces one or more constant members with consecutive
integral values starting at the specified constant value.
* A *ComputedEnumMember* introduces a computed member with a value computed by an
expression.

Expressions specified for computed members must produce values of type Any, the Number primitive
type, or the enum type itself.

In the example

```typescript
enum Test {
    A,
    B,
    C = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000),
    D = 10,
    E
}
```

`A`, `B`, `D`, and `E` are constant members with values 0, 1, 10, and 11 respectively, and `C` is a computed
member.

In the example

```typescript
enum Style {
    None = 0,
    Bold = 1,
    Italic = 2,
    Underline = 4,
    Emphasis = Bold | Italic,
    Hyperlink = Bold | Underline
}
```

the first four members are constant members and the last two are computed members. Note that
computed member declarations can reference other enum members without qualification. Also, because
enums are subtypes of the Number primitive type, numeric operators, such as the bitwise OR operator,
can be used to compute enum values.

## 9.3 Declaration Merging

Enums are "open-ended" and enum declarations with the same qualified name relative to a common root
(as defined in section 2.3) define a single enum type and contribute to a single enum object.

It isn't possible for one enum declaration to continue the automatic numbering sequence of another, and
when an enum type has multiple declarations, only one declaration is permitted to omit a value for the
first member.

## 9.4 Code Generation

An enum declaration generates JavaScript equivalent to the following:

```javascript
var <EnumName>;
(function (<EnumName>) {
    <EnumMemberAssignments>
})(<EnumName>||(<EnumName>={}));
```

EnumName is the name of the enum.

EnumMemberAssignments is a sequence of assignments, one for each enum member, in order they are
declared, of the form

```typescript
<EnumName>[<EnumName>["<MemberName>"] = <Value>] = "<MemberName>";
```

where MemberName is the name of the enum member and Value is the assigned constant value or the
code generated for the computed value expression.

For example, the `Color` enum example from section 9.1 generates the following JavaScript:

```typescript
var Color;
(function (Color) {
    Color[Color["Red"] = 0] = "Red";
    Color[Color["Green"] = 1] = "Green";
    Color[Color["Blue"] = 2] = "Blue";
})(Color||(Color={}));
```
