# 3 Types

TypeScript adds optional static types to JavaScript. Types are used to place static constraints on program
entities such as functions, variables, and properties so that compilers and development tools can offer
better verification and assistance during software development. TypeScript's *static* compile-time type
system closely models the *dynamic* run-time type system of JavaScript, allowing programmers to
accurately express the type relationships that are expected to exist when their programs run and have
those assumptions pre-validated by the TypeScript compiler. TypeScript's type analysis occurs entirely at
compile-time and adds no run-time overhead to program execution.

All types in TypeScript are subtypes of a single top type called the Any type. The any keyword references
this type. The Any type is the one type that can represent *any* JavaScript value with no constraints. All
other types are categorized as ***primitive types***, ***object types***, or ***type parameters***.
These types introduce various static constraints on their values.

The primitive types are the Number, Boolean, String, Void, Null, and Undefined types along with user
defined enum types. The number, boolean, string, and void keywords reference the Number, Boolean,
String, and Void primitive types respectively. The Void type exists purely to indicate the absence of a
value, such as in a function with no return value. It is not possible to explicitly reference the Null and
Undefined typesâ€”only *values* of those types can be referenced, using the null and undefined literals.

The object types are all class, interface, array, and literal types. Class and interface types are introduced
through class and interface declarations and are referenced by the name given to them in their
declarations. Class and interface types may be ***generic types*** which have one or more type parameters.
Literal types are written as object, array, function, or constructor type literals and are used to compose
new types from other types.

Declarations of modules, classes, properties, functions, variables and other language entities associate
types with those entities. The mechanism by which a type is formed and associated with a language entity
depends on the particular kind of entity. For example, a module declaration associates the module with an
anonymous type containing a set of properties corresponding to the exported variables and functions in
the module, and a function declaration associates the function with an anonymous type containing a call
signature corresponding to the parameters and return type of the function. Types can be associated with
variables through explicit ***type annotations***, such as

```typescript
var x: number;
```

or through implicit ***type inference***, as in

```typescript
var x = 1;
```

which infers the type of `x` to be the Number primitive type because that is the type of the value used to
initialize `x`.


## 3.1 The Any Type

The Any type is used to represent any JavaScript value. A value of the Any type supports the same
operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed for operations on Any
values. Specifically, properties of any name can be accessed through an Any value and Any values can be
called as functions or constructors with any argument list.

The any keyword references the Any type. In general, in places where a type is not explicitly provided and
TypeScript cannot infer one, the Any type is assumed.

The Any type is a supertype of all types, and is assignable to and from all types.

Some examples:

```typescript
var x: any;         // Explicitly typed
var y;              // Same as y: any
var z: { a; b; };   // Same as z: { a: any; b: any; }

function f(x) {     // Same as f(x: any): void
    console.log(x);
}
```

## 3.2 Primitive Types

The primitive types are the Number, Boolean, String, Void, Null, and Undefined types and all user defined
enum types.

### 3.2.1 The Number Type

The Number primitive type corresponds to the similarly named JavaScript primitive type and represents
double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 floating point values.

The number keyword references the Number primitive type and numeric literals may be used to write
values of the Number primitive type.

For purposes of determining type relationships (section 3.8) and accessing properties (section 4.10), the
Number primitive type behaves as an object type with the same properties as the global interface type
`Number`.

Some examples:

```typescript
var x: number;          // Explicitly typed
var y = 0;              // Same as y: number = 0
var z = 123.456;        // Same as z: number = 123.456
var s = z.toFixed(2);   // Property of Number interface
```

### 3.2.2 The Boolean Type

The Boolean primitive type corresponds to the similarly named JavaScript primitive type and represents
logical values that are either true or false.

The boolean keyword references the Boolean primitive type and the true and false literals reference
the two Boolean truth values.

For purposes of determining type relationships (section 3.8) and accessing properties (section 4.10), the
Boolean primitive type behaves as an object type with the same properties as the global interface type
`Boolean`.

Some examples:

```typescript
var b: boolean;         // Explicitly typed
var yes = true;         // Same as yes: boolean = true
var no = false;         // Same as no: boolean = false
```

### 3.2.3 The String Type

The String primitive type corresponds to the similarly named JavaScript primitive type and represents
sequences of characters stored as Unicode UTF-16 code units.

The string keyword references the String primitive type and string literals may be used to write values of
the String primitive type.

For purposes of determining type relationships (section 3.8) and accessing properties (section 4.10), the
String primitive type behaves as an object type with the same properties as the global interface type
`String`.

Some examples:

```typescript
var s: string;          // Explicitly typed
var empty = "";         // Same as empty: string = ""
var abc = 'abc';        // Same as abc: string = "abc"
var c = abc.charAt(2);  // Property of String interface
```

### 3.2.4 The Void Type

The Void type, referenced by the void keyword, represents the absence of a value and is used as the
return type of functions with no return value.

The only possible values for the Void type are null and undefined. The Void type is a subtype of the Any
type and a supertype of the Null and Undefined types, but otherwise Void is unrelated to all other types.

NOTE: We might consider disallowing declaring variables of type Void as they serve no useful purpose.
However, because Void is permitted as a type argument to a generic type or function it is not feasible to
disallow Void properties or parameters.


### 3.2.5 The Null Type

The Null type corresponds to the similarly named JavaScript primitive type and is the type of the null
literal.

The null literal references the one and only value of the Null type. It is not possible to directly reference
the Null type itself.

The Null type is a subtype of all types, except the Undefined type. This means that null is considered a
valid value for all primitive types, object types, and type parameters, including even the Number and
Boolean primitive types.

Some examples:

```typescript
var n: number = null;   // Primitives can be null
var x = null;           // Same as x: any = null
var e: Null;            // Error, can't reference Null type
```

### 3.2.6 The Undefined Type

The Undefined type corresponds to the similarly named JavaScript primitive type and is the type of the
undefined literal.

The undefined literal denotes the value given to all uninitialized variables and is the one and only value
of the Undefined type. It is not possible to directly reference the Undefined type itself.

The undefined type is a subtype of all types. This means that undefined is considered a valid value for all
primitive types, object types, and type parameters.

Some examples:

```typescript
var n: number;      // Same as n: number = undefined
var x = undefined;  // Same as x: any = undefined
var e: Undefined;   // Error, can't reference Undefined type
```

### 3.2.7 Enum Types

Enum types are distinct user defined subtypes of the Number primitive type. Enum types are declared
using enum declarations (section 9.1) and referenced using type references (section 3.6.2).

Enum types are assignable to the Number primitive type, and vice versa, but different enum types are not
assignable to each other.

### 3.2.8 String Literal Types

Specialized signatures (section 3.7.2.4) permit string literals to be used as types in parameter type
annotations. String literal types are permitted only in that context and nowhere else.

All string literal types are subtypes of the String primitive type.


## 3.3 Object Types

The object types include references to class and interface types as well as anonymous object types
created by a number of constructs such as object literals, function declarations, and module declarations.
Object types are composed from properties, call signatures, construct signatures, and index signatures,
collectively called members.

### 3.3.1 Named Type References

Type references (section 3.6.2) to class and interface types are classified as object types. Type references
to generic class and interface types include type arguments that are substituted for the type parameters
of the class or interface to produce an actual object type.

### 3.3.2 Array Types

Array types represent JavaScript arrays. Array types are type references (section 3.6.2) created from the
generic interface type `Array` in the global module. Array type literals (section 3.6.4) provide a shorthand
notation for creating such references.

Array literals (section 4.6) may be used to create values of array types.

### 3.3.3 Anonymous Types

Several constructs in the TypeScript language introduce new anonymous object types:

* Function and constructor type literals (section 3.6.4).
* Object type literals (section 3.7).
* Object literals (section 4.5).
* Function expressions (section 4.9) and function declarations (6.1).
* Constructor function types created by class declarations (section 8.2.5).
* Module instance types created by module declarations (section 10.3).


### 3.3.4 Members

Every object type is composed from zero or more of the following kinds of members:

* ***Properties***, which define the names and types of the properties of objects of the given type.
Property names are unique within their type.
* ***Call signatures***, which define the possible parameter lists and return types associated with
applying call operations to objects of the given type.
* ***Construct signatures***, which define the possible parameter lists and return types associated with
applying the new operator to objects of the given type.
* ***Index signatures***, which define type constraints for properties in the given type. An object type
can have at most one string index signature and one numeric index signature.


Properties are either ***public*** or ***private*** and are either ***required*** or ***optional***:


* Properties in a class declaration may be designated public or private, while properties declared in
other contexts are always considered public. Private members are only accessible within the class
body containing their declaration, as described in section 8.2.2, and private properties match only
themselves in subtype and assignment compatibility checks, as described in section 3.8.
* Properties in an object type literal or interface declaration may be designated required or
optional, while properties declared in other contexts are always considered required. Properties
that are optional in the target type of an assignment may be omitted from source objects, as
described in section 3.8.4.


Call and construct signatures may be ***specialized*** (section 3.7.2.4) by including parameters with string
literal types. Specialized signatures are used to express patterns where specific string values for some
parameters cause the types of other parameters or the function result to become further specialized.

## 3.4 Type Parameters

A type parameter represents an actual type that the parameter is bound to in a generic type reference or
a generic function call. Type parameters have constraints that establish upper bounds for their actual type
arguments.

Since a type parameter represents a multitude of different type arguments, type parameters have certain
restrictions compared to other types. In particular, a type parameter cannot be used as a base class or
interface.

### 3.4.1 Type Parameter Lists

Class, interface, and function declarations may optionally include lists of type parameters enclosed in <
and > brackets. Type parameters are also permitted in call signatures of object, function, and constructor
type literals.

```text
TypeParameters:
    < TypeParameterList >

TypeParameterList:
    TypeParameter
    TypeParameterList , TypeParameter

TypeParameter:
    Identifier Constraint(opt)

Constraint:
    extends Type
```

Type parameter names must be unique. A compile-time error occurs if two or more type parameters in
the same *TypeParameterList* have the same name.


The scope of a type parameter extends over the entire declaration with which the type parameter list is
associated, with the exception of static member declarations in classes.

Each type parameter has an associated type parameter ***constraint*** that establishes an upper bound for
type arguments. Omitting a constraint corresponds to specifying the empty object type {}. Type
parameters declared in a particular type parameter list may not be referenced in constraints in that type
parameter list.

The ***base constraint*** of a type parameter `T` is defined as follows:

* If `T` has no declared constraint, `T`'s base constraint is the empty object type {}.
* If `T`'s declared constraint is a type parameter, `T`'s base constraint is that of the type parameter.
* Otherwise, `T`'s base constraint is `T`'s declared constraint.


In the example

```typescript
interface G<T, U extends Function> {
    f<V extends U>(x: V): V;
}
```

the base constraint of `T` is the empty object type, and the base constraint of `U` and `V` is `Function`.

For purposes of determining type relationships (section 3.8), type parameters appear to be subtypes of
their base constraint. Likewise, in property accesses (section 4.10), new operations (section 4.11), and
function calls (section 4.12), type parameters appear to have the members of their base constraint, but no
other members.

### 3.4.2 Type Argument Lists

A type reference (section 3.6.2) to a generic type must include a list of type arguments enclosed in angle
brackets and separated by commas. Similarly, a call (section 4.12) to a generic function may explicitly
include a type argument list instead of relying on type inference.

```text
TypeArguments:
    < TypeArgumentList >

TypeArgumentList:
    TypeArgument
    TypeArgumentList , TypeArgument

TypeArgument:
    Type
```

Type arguments correspond one-to-one with type parameters of the generic type or function being
referenced. A type argument list is required to specify exactly one type argument for each corresponding
type parameter, and each type argument is required to ***satisfy*** the constraint of its corresponding type


parameter. A type argument satisfies a type parameter constraint if the type argument is assignable to
(section 3.8.4) the constraint type once type arguments are substituted for type parameters.

Given the declaration

```typescript
interface G<T, U extends Function> { }
```

a type reference of the form `G<A, B>` places no requirements on `A` but requires `B` to be assignable to
`Function`.

The process of substituting type arguments for type parameters in a generic type or generic signature is
known as ***instantiating*** the generic type or signature. Instantiation of a generic type or signature can fail
if the supplied type arguments do not satisfy the constraints of their corresponding type parameters.

## 3.5 Named Types

Class, interface, and enum types are ***named types*** that are introduced through class declarations (section
8.1), interface declarations (section 7.1), and enum declarations (9.1). Class and interface types may have
type parameters and are then called ***generic types***. Conversely, named types without type parameters are
called ***non-generic types***.

Interface declarations only introduce named types, whereas class declarations introduce named types and
constructor functions that create instances of implementations of those named types. The named types
introduced by class and interface declarations have only minor differences (classes can't declare optional
members and interfaces can't declare private members) and are in most contexts interchangeable. In
particular, class declarations with only public members introduce named types that function exactly like
those created by interface declarations.

Named types are referenced through ***type references*** (section 3.6.2) that specify a type name and, if
applicable, the type arguments to be substituted for the type parameters of the named type.

Named types are technically not typesâ€”only *references* to named types are. This distinction is particularly
evident with generic types: Generic types are "templates" from which multiple actual types can be created
by writing type references that supply type arguments to substitute in place of the generic type's type
parameters. This substitution process is known as ***instantiating*** a generic type. Only once a generic type
is instantiated does it denote an actual type.

TypeScript has a structural type system, and therefore an instantiation of a generic type is
indistinguishable from an equivalent manually written expansion. For example, given the declaration

```typescript
interface Pair<T1, T2> { first: T1; second: T2; }
```

the type reference

```typescript
Pair<string, Entity>
```

is indistinguishable from the type

```typescript
{ first: string; second: Entity; }
```

### 3.5.1 Instance Types

Each named type has an associated actual type known as the ***instance type***. For a non-generic type, the
instance type is simply a type reference to the non-generic type. For a generic type, the instance type is an
instantiation of the generic type where each of the type arguments is the corresponding type parameter.
Since the instance type uses the type parameters it can be used only where the type parameters are in
scopeâ€”that is, inside the declaration of the generic type. Within the constructor and instance member
functions of a class, the type of this is the instance type of the class.

The following example illustrates the concept of an instance type:

```typescript
class G<T> {                // Introduce type parameter T
    self: G<T>;             // Use T as type argument to form instance type
    f() {
        this.self = this;   // self and this are both of type G<T>
    }
}
```

## 3.6 Specifying Types

Types are specified either by referencing their keyword or name, by querying expression types, or by
writing type literals which compose other types into new types.

```text
Type:
    PredefinedType
    TypeReference
    TypeQuery
    TypeLiteral
```

### 3.6.1 Predefined Types

The any, number, boolean, string, and void keywords reference the Any type and the Number, Boolean,
String, and Void primitive types respectively.

```text
PredefinedType:
    any
    number
    boolean
    string
    void
```

The predefined type keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names of user defined types.


### 3.6.2 Type References

A type reference references a named type or type parameter through its name and, in the case of a
generic type, supplies a type argument list.

```text
TypeReference:
    TypeName [no LineTerminator here] TypeArguments(opt)

TypeName:
    Identifier
    ModuleName . Identifier

ModuleName:
    Identifier
    ModuleName . Identifier
```

A *TypeReference* consists of a *TypeName* that a references a named type or type parameter. A reference to
a generic type must be followed by a list of *TypeArguments* (section 3.4.2).

Resolution of a *TypeName* consisting of a single identifier is described in section 2.4.

Resolution of a *TypeName* of the form *M.N*, where *M* is a *ModuleName* and *N* is an *Identifier*, proceeds by
first resolving the module name *M*. If the resolution of *M* is successful and the resulting module contains
an exported named type *N*, then *M.N* refers to that member. Otherwise, *M.N* is undefined.

Resolution of a *ModuleName* consisting of a single identifier is described in section 2.4.

Resolution of a *ModuleName* of the form *M.N*, where *M* is a *ModuleName* and *N* is an *Identifier*, proceeds
by first resolving the module name *M*. If the resolution of *M* is successful and the resulting module
contains an exported module member *N*, then *M.N* refers to that member. Otherwise, *M.N* is undefined.

A type reference to a generic type is required to specify exactly one type argument for each type
parameter of the referenced generic type, and each type argument must be assignable to (section 3.8.4)
the constraint of the corresponding type parameter or otherwise an error occurs. An example:

```typescript
interface A { a: string; }

interface B extends A { b: string; }

interface C extends B { c: string; }

interface G<T, U extends B> {
    x: T;
    y: U;
}

var v1: G<A, C>;                // Ok
var v2: G<{ a: string }, C>;    // Ok, equivalent to G<A, C>
var v3: G<A, A>;                // Error, A not valid argument for U
var v4: G<G<A, B>, C>;          // Ok
var v5: G<any, any>;            // Ok
var v6: G<any>;                 // Error, wrong number of arguments
var v7: G;                      // Error, no arguments
```

A type argument is simply a *Type* and may itself be a type reference to a generic type, as demonstrated by
`v4` in the example above.

As described in section 3.5, a type reference to a generic type G designates a type wherein all occurrences
of G's type parameters have been replaced with the actual type arguments supplied in the type reference.
For example, the declaration of `v1` above is equivalent to:

```typescript
var v1: {
    x: { a: string; }
    y: { a: string; b: string; c: string };
};
```

### 3.6.3 Type Queries

A type query obtains the type of an expression.

```text
TypeQuery:
    typeof TypeQueryExpression

TypeQueryExpression:
    Identifier
    TypeQueryExpression . IdentifierName
```

A type query consists of the keyword `typeof` followed by an expression. The expression is restricted to a
single identifier or a sequence of identifiers separated by periods. The expression is processed as an
identifier expression (section 4.3) or property access expression (section 4.10), the widened type (section
3.9) of which becomes the result. Similar to other static typing constructs, type queries are erased from
the generated JavaScript code and add no run-time overhead.

Type queries are useful for capturing anonymous types that are generated by various constructs such as
object literals, function declarations, and module declarations. For example:

```typescript
var a = { x: 10, y: 20 };
var b: typeof a;
```

Above, `b` is given the same type as `a`, namely `{ x: number; y: number; }`.

### 3.6.4 Type Literals

Type literals compose other types into new anonymous types.

```text
TypeLiteral:
    ObjectType
    ArrayType
    FunctionType
    ConstructorType

ArrayType:
    ElementType [no LineTerminator here] [ ]

ElementType:
    PredefinedType
    TypeReference
    TypeQuery
    ObjectType
    ArrayType

FunctionType:
    TypeParameters(opt) ( ParameterList(opt) ) => Type

ConstructorType:
    new TypeParameters(opt) ( ParameterList(opt) ) => Type
```

Object type literals are the primary form of type literals and are described in section 3.7. Array, function,
and constructor type literals are simply shorthand notations for other types:

| Type literal | Equivalent form |
| ---- | ---- |
| T [ ] | Array < T > |
| < TParams > ( Params ) => Result | { < TParams > ( Params ) : Result } |
| new < TParams > ( Params ) => Result | { new < TParams > ( Params ) : Result } |

As the table above illustrates, an array type literal is shorthand for a reference to the generic interface type
`Array` in the global module, a function type literal is shorthand for an object type containing a single call
signature, and a constructor type literal is shorthand for an object type containing a single construct
signature. Note that function and constructor types with multiple call or construct signatures cannot be
written as function or constructor type literals but must instead be written as object type literals.

In order to avoid grammar ambiguities, array type literals permit only a restricted set of notations for the
element type. Specifically, an *ArrayType* cannot start with a *FunctionType* or *ConstructorType*. To use one
of those forms for the element type, an array type must be written using the `Array<T>` notation. For
example, the type

```typescript
() => string[]
```

denotes a function returning a string array, not an array of functions returning string. The latter can be
expressed using `Array<T>` notation

```typescript
Array<() => string>
```

or by writing the element type as an object type literal

```typescript
{ (): string }[]
```

## 3.7 Object Type Literals

An object type literal defines an object type by specifying the set of members that are statically
considered to be present in instances of the type. Object type literals can be given names using interface
declarations but are otherwise anonymous.

```text
ObjectType:
    { TypeBody(opt) }

TypeBody:
    TypeMemberList ;(opt)

TypeMemberList:
    TypeMember
    TypeMemberList ; TypeMember

TypeMember:
    PropertySignature
    CallSignature
    ConstructSignature
    IndexSignature
    MethodSignature
```

The members of an object type literal are specified as a combination of property, call, construct, index,
and method signatures. The signatures are separated by semicolons and enclosed in curly braces.

### 3.7.1 Property Signatures

A property signature declares the name and type of a property member.

```text
PropertySignature:
    PropertyName ?(opt) TypeAnnotation(opt)

PropertyName:
    IdentifierName
    StringLiteral
    NumericLiteral
```

The *PropertyName* production, reproduced above from the ECMAScript grammar, permits a property
name to be any identifier (including a reserved word), a string literal, or a numeric literal. String literals can
be used to give properties names that are not valid identifiers, such as names containing blanks. Numeric
literal property names are equivalent to string literal property names with the string representation of the
numeric literal, as defined in the ECMAScript specification.

The *PropertyName* of a property signature must be unique within its containing type. If the property name
is followed by a question mark, the property is optional. Otherwise, the property is required.

If a property signature omits a *TypeAnnotation*, the Any type is assumed.

### 3.7.2 Call Signatures

A call signature defines the type parameters, parameter list, and return type associated with applying a
call operation (section 4.12) to an instance of the containing type. A type may ***overload*** call operations by
defining multiple different call signatures.

```text
CallSignature:
    TypeParameters(opt) ( ParameterList(opt) ) TypeAnnotation(opt)
```

A call signature that includes *TypeParameters* (section 3.4.1) is called a generic call signature. Conversely,
a call signature with no *TypeParameters* is called a non-generic call signature.

As well as being members of object type literals, call signatures occur in method signatures (section 3.7.5),
function expressions (section 4.9), and function declarations (section 6.1).

An object type containing call signatures is said to be a ***function type***.

#### 3.7.2.1 Type Parameters

Type parameters (section 3.4.1) in call signatures provide a mechanism for expressing the relationships of
parameter and return types in call operations. For example, a signature might introduce a type parameter
and use it as both a parameter type and a return type, in effect describing a function that returns a value
of the same type as its argument.

Type parameters may be referenced in parameter types and return type annotations, but not in type
parameter constraints, of the call signature in which they are introduced.

Type arguments (section 3.4.2) for call signature type parameters may be explicitly specified in a call
operation or may, when possible, be inferred (section 4.12.2) from the types of the regular arguments in
the call. An ***instantiation*** of a generic call signature for a particular set of type arguments is the call
signature formed by replacing each type parameter with its corresponding type argument.

Some examples of call signatures with type parameters:

| <T>(x: T): T | A function taking an argument of any type, returning a value of that same type. |
| <T>(x: T, y: T): T[] | A function taking two values of the same type, returning an array of that type. |
| <T, U>(x: T, y: U): { x: T; y: U; } | A function taking two arguments of different types, returning an object with properties `x` and `y` of those types. |
| <T, U>(a: T[], f: (x: T) => U): U[] | A function taking an array of one type and a function argument, returning an array of another type, where the function argument takes a value of the first array element type and returns a value of the second array element type. |


#### 3.7.2.2 Parameter List

A signature's parameter list consists of zero or more required parameters, followed by zero or more
optional parameters, finally followed by an optional rest parameter.

```text
ParameterList:
    RequiredParameterList
    OptionalParameterList
    RestParameter
    RequiredParameterList , OptionalParameterList
    RequiredParameterList , RestParameter
    OptionalParameterList , RestParameter
    RequiredParameterList , OptionalParameterList , RestParameter

RequiredParameterList:
    RequiredParameter
    RequiredParameterList , RequiredParameter

RequiredParameter:
    PublicOrPrivate(opt) Identifier TypeAnnotation(opt)
    Identifier : StringLiteral

PublicOrPrivate:
    public
    private

OptionalParameterList:
    OptionalParameter
    OptionalParameterList , OptionalParameter

OptionalParameter:
    PublicOrPrivate(opt) Identifier ? TypeAnnotation(opt)
    PublicOrPrivate(opt) Identifier TypeAnnotation(opt) Initialiser

RestParameter:
    ... Identifier TypeAnnotation(opt)
```

Parameter names must be unique. A compile-time error occurs if two or more parameters have the same
name.

A parameter is permitted to include a public or private modifier only if it occurs in the parameter list of
a *ConstructorImplementation* (section 8.3.1).

A parameter with a type annotation is considered to be of that type. A type annotation for a rest
parameter must denote an array type.

A parameter with no type annotation or initializer is considered to be of type any, unless it is a rest
parameter, in which case it is considered to be of type any[].

When a parameter type annotation specifies a string literal type, the containing signature is a specialized
signature (section 3.7.2.4). Specialized signatures are not permitted in conjunction with a function body,
i.e. the *FunctionExpression*, *FunctionImplementation*, *MemberFunctionImplementation*, and
*ConstructorImplementation* grammar productions do not permit parameters with string literal types.

A parameter can be marked optional by following its name with a question mark (?) or by including an
initializer. The form that includes an initializer is permitted only in conjunction with a function body, i.e.
only in a *FunctionExpression*, *FunctionImplementation*, *MemberFunctionImplementation*, or
*ConstructorImplementation* grammar production.

#### 3.7.2.3 Return Type

If present, a call signature's return type annotation specifies the type of the value computed and returned
by a call operation. A void return type annotation is used to indicate that a function has no return value.

When a call signature with no return type annotation occurs in a context without a function body, the
return type is assumed to be the Any type.

When a call signature with no return type annotation occurs in a context that has a function body
(specifically, a function implementation, a member function implementation, or a member accessor
declaration), the return type is inferred from the function body as described in section 6.3.

#### 3.7.2.4 Specialized Signatures

When a parameter type annotation specifies a string literal type (section 3.2.8), the containing signature is
considered a specialized signature. Specialized signatures are used to express patterns where specific
string values for some parameters cause the types of other parameters or the function result to become
further specialized. For example, the declaration


```typescript
interface Document {
    createElement(tagName: "div"): HTMLDivElement;
    createElement(tagName: "span"): HTMLSpanElement;
    createElement(tagName: "canvas"): HTMLCanvasElement;
    createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;
}
```

states that calls to `createElement` with the string literals "div", "span", and "canvas" return values of type
`HTMLDivElement`, `HTMLSpanElement`, and `HTMLCanvasElement` respectively, and that calls with all
other string expressions return values of type `HTMLElement`.

When writing overloaded declarations such as the one above it is important to list the non-specialized
signature last. This is because overload resolution (section 4.12.1) processes the candidates in declaration
order and picks the first one that matches.

Every specialized call or construct signature in an object type must be assignable to at least one non-
specialized call or construct signature in the same object type (where a call signature *A* is considered
assignable to another call signature *B* if an object type containing only *A* would be assignable to an object
type containing only *B*). For example, the `createElement` property in the example above is of a type that
contains three specialized signatures, all of which are assignable to the non-specialized signature in the
type.

### 3.7.3 Construct Signatures

A construct signature defines the parameter list and return type associated with applying the new
operator (section 4.11) to an instance of the containing type. A type may overload new operations by
defining multiple construct signatures with different parameter lists.

```text
ConstructSignature:
    new TypeParameters(opt) ( ParameterList(opt) ) TypeAnnotation(opt)
```

The type parameters, parameter list, and return type of a construct signature are subject to the same rules
as a call signature.

A type containing construct signatures is said to be a ***constructor type***.

### 3.7.4 Index Signatures

An index signature defines a type constraint for properties in the containing type.

```text
IndexSignature:
    [ Identifier : string ] TypeAnnotation
    [ Identifier : number ] TypeAnnotation
```

There are two kinds of index signatures:

* ***String index*** signatures, specified using index type string, define type constraints for all
properties and numeric index signatures in the containing type. Specifically, in a type with a string
index signature of type *T*, all properties and numeric index signatures must have types that are
assignable to *T*.
* ***Numeric index signatures***, specified using index type number, define type constraints for all
numerically named properties in the containing type. Specifically, in a type with a numeric index
signature of type *T*, all numerically named properties must have types that are assignable to *T*.

A ***numerically named property*** is a property whose name is a valid numeric literal. Specifically, a
property with a name *N* for which ToNumber(*N*) is not NaN, where ToNumber is the abstract operation
defined in ECMAScript specification.

An object type can contain at most one string index signature and one numeric index signature.

Index signatures affect the determination of the type that results from applying a bracket notation
property access to an instance of the containing type, as described in section 4.10.

### 3.7.5 Method Signatures

A method signature is shorthand for declaring a property of a function type.

```text
MethodSignature:
    PropertyName ?(opt) CallSignature
```

If the identifier is followed by a question mark, the property is optional. Otherwise, the property is
required. Only object type literals and interfaces can declare optional properties.

A method signature of the form

```text
PropName < TypeParamList > ( ParamList ) : ReturnType
```

is equivalent to the property declaration

```text
PropName : { < TypeParamList > ( ParamList ) : ReturnType }
```

A literal type may ***overload*** a method by declaring multiple method signatures with the same name but
differing parameter lists. Overloads must either all be required (question mark omitted) or all be optional
(question mark included). A set of overloaded method signatures correspond to a declaration of a single
property with a type composed from an equivalent set of call signatures. Specifically

```text
PropName < TypeParamList1 > ( ParamList1 ) : ReturnType1 ;
PropName < TypeParamList2 > ( ParamList2 ) : ReturnType2 ;
...
PropName < TypeParamListn > ( ParamListn ) : ReturnTypen ;
```

is equivalent to

```text
PropName : {
    < TypeParamList1 > ( ParamList1 ) : ReturnType1 ;
    < TypeParamList2 > ( ParamList2 ) : ReturnType2 ;
    ...
    < TypeParamListn > ( ParamListn ) : ReturnTypen ; }
```

In the following example of an object type

```typescript
{
    func1(x: number): number;       // Method signature
    func2: (x: number) => number;   // Function type literal
    func3: { (x: number): number }; // Object type literal
}
```

the properties `func1`, `func2`, and `func3` are all of the same type, namely an object type with a single call
signature taking a number and returning a number. Likewise, in the object type

```typescript
{
    func4(x: number): number;
    func4(s: string): string;
    func5: {
        (x: number): number;
        (s: string): string;
    };
}
```

the properties `func4` and `func5` are of the same type, namely an object type with two call signatures
taking and returning number and string respectively.

## 3.8 Type Relationships

Types in TypeScript have identity, subtype, supertype, and assignment compatibility relationships as
defined in the following sections.

For purposes of determining type relationships, all object types appear to have the members of the
`Object` interface unless those members are hidden by members with the same name in the object types,
and object types with one or more call or construct signatures appear to have the members of the
`Function` interface unless those members are hidden by members with the same name in the object
types. Apparent types (section 3.8.1) that are object types appear to have these extra members as well.

### 3.8.1 Apparent Type

In certain contexts a type appears to have the characteristics of a related type called the type's ***apparent
type***. Specifically, a type's apparent type is used when determining subtype, supertype, and assignment
compatibility relationships, as well as in the type checking of property accesses (section 4.10), new
operations (section 4.11), and function calls (section 4.12).


The apparent type of a type T is defined as follows:

* If T is the primitive type Number, Boolean, or String, the apparent type of T is the augmented
form (as defined below) of the global interface type `Number`, `Boolean`, or `String`.
* if T is an enum type, the apparent type of T is the augmented form of the global interface type
`Number`.
* If T is an object type, the apparent type of T is the augmented form of T.
* If T is a type parameter, the apparent type of T is the apparent type of T's base constraint (section
3.4.1).
* Otherwise, the apparent type of T is T itself.


The augmented form of an object type T adds to T those members of the global interface type `Object`
that aren't hidden by members in T. Furthermore, if T has one or more call or construct signatures, the
augmented form of T adds to T the members of the global interface type `Function` that aren't hidden by
members in T. Members in T hide `Object` or `Function` interface members in the following manner:

* A property hides an `Object` or `Function` property with the same name.
* A call signature hides an `Object` or `Function` call signature with the same number of parameters
and identical parameter types in the respective positions.
* A construct signature hides an `Object` or `Function` construct signature with the same number of
parameters and identical parameter types in the respective positions.
* An index signature hides an `Object` or `Function` index signature with the same parameter type.


In effect, a type's apparent type is a subtype of the `Object` or `Function` interface unless the type defines
members that are incompatible with those of the `Object` or `Function` interfaceâ€”which, for example,
occurs if the type defines a property with the same name as a property in the `Object` or `Function`
interface but with a type that isn't a subtype of that in the `Object` or `Function` interface.

Some examples:

```typescript
var o: Object = { x: 10, y: 20 };       // Ok
var f: Function = (x: number) => x * x; // Ok
var err: Object = { toString: 0 };      // Error
```

The last assignment is an error because the apparent type of the object literal has a `toString` method that
isn't compatible with that of `Object`.

### 3.8.2 Type and Member Identity

Two types are considered ***identical*** when

* they are both the Any type,
* they are the same primitive type,
* they are the same type parameter, or
* they are object types with identical sets of members.



Two members are considered identical when

* they are public properties with identical names, optionality, and types,
* they are private properties originating in the same declaration and having identical types,
* they are identical call signatures,
* they are identical construct signatures, or
* they are index signatures of identical kind with identical types.


Two call or construct signatures are considered identical when they have the same number of type
parameters with identical type parameter constraints and, after substituting type Any for the type
parameters introduced by the signatures, identical number of parameters with identical kind (required,
optional or rest) and types, and identical return types.

Note that, except for primitive types and classes with private members, it is structure, not naming, of types
that determines identity. Also, note that parameter names are not significant when determining identity of
signatures.

Private properties match only if they originate in the same declaration and have identical types. Two
distinct types might contain properties that originate in the same declaration if the types are separate
parameterized references to the same generic class. In the example

```typescript
class C<T> { private x: T; }

interface X { f(): string; }

interface Y { f(): string; }

var a: C<X>;
var b: C<Y>;
```

the variables `a` and `b` are of identical types because the two type references to `C` create types with a
private member `x` that originates in the same declaration, and because the two private `x` members have
types with identical sets of members once the type arguments `X` and `Y` are substituted.

### 3.8.3 Subtypes and Supertypes

S is a ***subtype*** of a type T, and T is a ***supertype*** of S, if one of the following is true, where S' denotes the
apparent type (section 3.8.1) of S:

* S and T are identical types.
* T is the Any type.
* S is the Undefined type.
* S is the Null type and T is not the Undefined type.
* S is an enum type and T is the primitive type Number.
* S is a string literal type and T is the primitive type String.
* S and T are type parameters, and S is directly or indirectly constrained to T.
* S' and T are object types and, for each member M in T, one of the following is true:
    * M is a property and S' contains a property N where
        * M and N have the same name,
        * the type of N is a subtype of that of M,
        * M and N are both public, or M and N are both private and originate in the same
        declaration, and
        * if M is a required property, N is also a required property.
    * M is an optional property and S' contains no property of the same name as M.
    * M is a non-specialized call or construct signature and S' contains a call or construct
signature N where, when M and N are instantiated using type Any as the type argument
for all type parameters declared by M and N (if any),
        * the signatures are of the same kind (call or construct),
        * M has a rest parameter or the number of non-optional parameters in N is less
        than or equal to the total number of parameters in M,
        * for parameter positions that are present in both signatures, each parameter type
        in N is a subtype or supertype of the corresponding parameter type in M, and
        * the result type of M is Void, or the result type of N is a subtype of that of M.
    * M is a string index signature of type U and S' contains a string index signature of a type
that is a subtype of U.
    * M is a numeric index signature of type U and S' contains a string or numeric index
signature of a type that is a subtype of U.

When comparing call or construct signatures, parameter names are ignored and rest parameters
correspond to an unbounded expansion of optional parameters of the rest parameter element type.

Note that specialized call and construct signatures (section 3.7.2.4) are not significant when determining
subtype and supertype relationships.

Also note that type parameters are not considered object types. Thus, the only subtypes of a type
parameter T are T itself and other type parameters that are directly or indirectly constrained to T.

### 3.8.4 Assignment Compatibility

Types are required to be assignment compatible in certain circumstances, such as expression and variable
types in assignment statements and argument and parameter types in function calls.

S is ***assignable*** to a type T, and T is ***assignable from*** S, if one of the following is true, where S' denotes
the apparent type (section 3.8.1) of S:

* S and T are identical types.
* S or T is the Any type.
* S is the Undefined type.
* S is the Null type and T is not the Undefined type.
* S or T is an enum type and the other is the primitive type Number.
* S is a string literal type and T is the primitive type String.
* S and T are type parameters, and S is directly or indirectly constrained to T.
* S' and T are object types and, for each member M in T, one of the following is true:
    * M is a property and S' contains a property N where
        * M and N have the same name,
        * the type of N is assignable to that of M,
        * M and N are both public, or M and N are both private and originate in the same
        declaration, and
        * if M is a required property, N is also a required property.
    * M is an optional property and S' contains no property of the same name as M.
    * M is a non-specialized call or construct signature and S' contains a call or construct
    signature N where, when M and N are instantiated using type Any as the type argument
    for all type parameters declared by M and N (if any),
        * the signatures are of the same kind (call or construct),
        * M has a rest parameter or the number of non-optional parameters in N is less
        than or equal to the total number of parameters in M,
        * for parameter positions that are present in both signatures, each parameter type
        in N is assignable to or from the corresponding parameter type in M, and
        * the result type of M is Void, or the result type of N is assignable to that of M.
    * M is a string index signature of type U and S' contains a string index signature of a type
that is assignable to U.
    * M is a numeric index signature of type U and S' contains a string or numeric index
signature of a type that is assignable to U.

When comparing call or construct signatures, parameter names are ignored and rest parameters
correspond to an unbounded expansion of optional parameters of the rest parameter element type.

Note that specialized call and construct signatures (section 3.7.2.4) are not significant when determining
assignment compatibility.

The assignment compatibility and subtyping rules differ only in that

* the Any type is assignable to, but not a subtype of, all types, and
* the primitive type Number is assignable to, but not a subtype of, all enum types.


The assignment compatibility rules imply that, when assigning values or passing parameters, optional
properties must either be present and of a compatible type, or not be present at all. For example:

```typescript
function foo(x: { id: number; name?: string; }) { }

foo({ id: 1234 });                  // Ok
foo({ id: 1234, name: "hello" });   // Ok
foo({ id: 1234, name: false });     // Error, name of wrong type
foo({ name: "hello" });             // Error, id required but missing
```

### 3.8.5 Contextual Signature Instantiation

During type argument inference in a function call (section 4.12.2) it is in certain circumstances necessary
to instantiate a generic call signature of an argument expression in the context of a non-generic call
signature of a parameter such that further inferences can be made. A generic call signature A is
***instantiated in the context of*** non-generic call signature B as follows:

* Using the process described in 3.8.6, inferences for A's type parameters are made from each
parameter type in B to the corresponding parameter type in A for those parameter positions that
are present in both signatures, where rest parameters correspond to an unbounded expansion of
optional parameters of the rest parameter element type.
* The inferred type argument for each type parameter is the best common type (section 3.10) of the
set of inferences made for that type parameter. However, if the best common type does not
satisfy the constraint of the type parameter, the inferred type argument is instead the constraint.


### 3.8.6 Type Inference

In certain contexts, inferences for a given set of type parameters are made from a type S, in which those
type parameters do not occur, to another type T, in which those type parameters do occur. Inferences
consist of a set of candidate type arguments collected for each of the type parameters. The inference
process recursively relates S and T to gather as many inferences as possible:

* If T is one of the type parameters for which inferences are being made, S is added to the set of
inferences for that type parameter.
* Otherwise, if S and T are object types, then for each member M in T:
    * If M is a property and S contains a property N with the same name as M, inferences are
made from the type of N to the type of M.
    * If M is a call signature then for each call signature N in S, N is instantiated with the Any
type as an argument for each type parameter (if any) and inferences are made from
parameter types in N to the corresponding parameter types in M for positions that are
present in both signatures, and from the return type of N to the return type of M.
    * If M is a construct signature then for each construct signature N in S, N is instantiated
with the Any type as an argument for each type parameter (if any) and inferences are
made from parameter types in N to the corresponding parameter types in M for positions
that are present in both signatures, and from the return type of N to the return type of M.
    * If M is a string index signature and S contains a string index signature N, inferences are
made from the type of N to the type of M.
    * If M is a numeric index signature and S contains a numeric index signature N, inferences
are made from the type of N to the type of M.


### 3.8.7 Recursive Types

Classes and interfaces can reference themselves in their internal structure, in effect creating recursive
types with infinite nesting. For example, the type

```typescript
interface A { next: A; }
```

contains an infinitely nested sequence of `next` properties. Types such as this are perfectly valid but
require special treatment when determining type relationships. Specifically, when comparing types S and T
for a given relationship (identity, subtype, or assignability), the relationship in question is assumed to be
true for every directly or indirectly nested occurrence of the same S and the same T (where same means
originating in the same declaration and, if applicable, having identical type arguments). For example,
consider the identity relationship between `A` above and `B` below:

```typescript
interface B { next: C; }

interface C { next: D; }

interface D { next: B; }
```

To determine whether `A` and `B` are identical, first the `next` properties of type `A` and `C` are compared.
That leads to comparing the `next` properties of type `A` and `D`, which leads to comparing the `next`
properties of type `A` and `B`. Since `A` and `B` are already being compared this relationship is by definition
true. That in turn causes the other comparisons to be true, and therefore the final result is true.

When this same technique is used to compare generic type references, two type references are
considered the same when they originate in the same declaration and have identical type arguments.

In certain circumstances, generic types that directly or indirectly reference themselves in a recursive
fashion can lead to infinite series of distinct instantiations. For example, in the type

```typescript
interface List<T> {
    data: T;
    next: List<T>;
    owner: List<List<T>>;
}
```

`List<T>` has a member `owner` of type `List<List<T>>`, which has a member `owner` of type
`List<List<List<T>>>`, which has a member `owner` of type `List<List<List<List<T>>>>` and so on, ad
infinitum. Since type relationships are determined structurally, possibly exploring the constituent types to
their full depth, in order to determine type relationships involving infinitely expanding generic types it is
necessary to introduce a mechanism that terminates the recursion.

Within a generic class or interface G, type references contained in declared or inherited members are
classified as follows

* A type reference without type arguments or with type arguments that do not reference any of G's
type parameters is classified as a ***closed*** type reference.
* A type reference that references any of G's type parameters in a type argument is classified as an
***open*** type reference.
* A type reference which, directly or indirectly, references G through open type references and
which contains a wrapped form of any of G's type parameters in one or more type arguments is
classified as an ***infinitely expanding*** type reference. A type is said to wrap a type parameter if it
references the type parameter but isn't simply the type parameter itself.


A type is said to originate in an infinitely expanding type reference if it was created (by instantiation of a
generic class or interface) from an infinitely expanding type reference (in that generic class or interface).

When comparing two types S and T for identity (section 3.8.2), subtype (section 3.8.3), and assignability
(section 3.8.4) relationships, if either type originates in an infinitely expanding type reference and the
other is not the Any, Null, or Undefined type, S and T are not compared by the rules in the preceding
sections. Instead, for the relationship to be considered true,

* S and T must both be type references to the same named type, and
* the relationship in question must be true for each corresponding pair of type arguments in the
type argument lists of S and T.


Likewise, when making type inferences (section 3.8.6) from a type S to a type T, if either type originates in
an infinitely expanding type reference, then

* if S and T are type references to the same named type, inferences are made from each type
argument in S to each type argument in T,
* otherwise, no inferences are made.


Referring to the example above, the `List<T>` type reference in the `next` property is classified as an open
type reference and the `List<List<T>>` type reference in the `owner` property is classified as an infinitely
expanding type reference.

## 3.9 Widened Types

In several situations TypeScript infers types from context, alleviating the need for the programmer to
explicitly specify types that appear obvious. For example

```typescript
var name = "Steve";
```

infers the type of `name` to be the String primitive type since that is the type of the value used to initialize
it. When inferring the type of a variable, property or function result from an expression, the ***widened*** form
of the source type is used as the inferred type of the target. The widened form of a type is the type in
which all occurrences of the Null and Undefined types have been replaced with the type any.

The following example shows the results of widening types to produce inferred variable types.

```typescript
var a = null;                   // var a: any
var b = undefined;              // var b: any
var c = { x: 0, y: null };      // var c: { x: number, y: any }
var d = [ null, undefined ];    // var d: any[]
```


## 3.10 Best Common Type

In some cases a ***best common type*** needs to be inferred from a set of types. In particular, return types of
functions with multiple return statements and element types of array literals are found this way.

For an empty set of types, the best common type is an empty object type (the type {}).

For a non-empty set of types { T1, T2, ..., Tn }, the best common type is the one Tx in the set that is a
supertype of every Tn. It is possible that no such type exists or more than one such type exists, in which
case the best common type is an empty object type.
